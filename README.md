# Portfolio

A one page portfolio with a short profile and small list of my top projects. Clicking on the images also brings up a short description via the jQuery modal.

## How to view

- Clone the repo or download and unzip the zip file.
- Open the index.html file in a web browser.

## How the portfolio was made

The project was built using widely accepted html and css practices. This was done following style guides with the formatting created following an initial design mockup.
